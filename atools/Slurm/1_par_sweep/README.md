# Simple parameter sweep demo with atools.

This example runs the ``weather`` script for a range of input values
specified as rows in a comma-separated spreadsheet file.

  * Execute the submit script ``submit.sh``
    Look at how ``arange`` is used to determine the array indices in
    that script.
  * Observe the output that is generated.
  * ``clean.sh`` can then be used to clean the directory again.
