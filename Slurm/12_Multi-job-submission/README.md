# Chapter 12: Multi-job submission

Here we can no longer follow the tutorial as worker is not supported on Slurm.
It is more logical to first look at job arrays and then see how a parameter
sweep can be implemented using ``atools``, which relies on job arrays to do
its work.

  * [Job arrays](1_job_array) - Example based on chapter 12.2

  * [Parameter sweeps](2_par_sweep) - Example based on chapter 12.1
