* file1a scripts: Simple output
  - Torque: file1a.pbs will generate three output files: The file hello.txt,
    one of the form file1a.pbs.o<jobid> which contains all output sent to stdout,
    including some information form Torque, and a file of the form
    file1a.pbs.e<jobid> with all output sent to stderr.
  - Slurm: 
    + file1a.slurm only generates two files: The file hello.txt and a
      file of the form slurm-<jobid>.out. The latter contains all output sent to
      stdout and stderr. By default, these are sent to the same file in 
      Slurm.
    + file1aa.slurm solves this problem by adding the line
      #SBATCH --error=slurm-%j.err
      to the job script. Now stdout is sent to a file of the form
      slurm-<jobid>.out and stderr is sent to a file of the form
      slurm-<jobid>.err.
* file1b scripts: Giving the job a name and using that name for the files
  to which stdout and stderr are redirected.
  - Torque: file1b.pbs: This script again generates three files, but the two
    files whose name contained the name of the job script, are now renamed. The
    name of the job script is replaced by the name given to the job, my_serial_job,
    so we now have the file my_serial_job.o<jobid> and my_serial_job.e<jobid>
    besides the file Hello.txt.
  - Slurm: In Slurm it requires a bit more work to include the job name in
    the name of the output files. We now used --job-name to change the name of the
    job, but also needed to specify two file name templates for stdout and stderr:
    #SBATCH --output=%x-%j.out
    #SBATCH --error=%x-%j.err
    %x in this template stands for the name of the job, %j for the job id, so we
    will get the files my_serial_job-<jobid>.out and my_serial_job-<jobid>.err
    with stdout and stderr respectively.
* file1c scripts: Give explicit names to the files that receive output sent to
  stdout and stderr.
  - Torque: file1c.pbs generates the files Hello.txt, stdout.<jobid> and 
    stderr.<jobid>. Note in the script how the PBS_ environment variables can
    be used as part of the name.
  - Slurm: file1c.slurm generates the same three files Hello.txt, stdout.<jobid> 
    and stderr.<jobid>. However, the name of the file is given through a template
    with various codes for jobid etc. and not using SLURM_ environment variables.
    Those codes can be found in the manual page for sbatch.
* file2 scripts: A Python script that also writes a file on $VSC_SCRATCH, but 
  otherwise largely equivalent to file1c.
  - Both the Slurm and PBS scripts generate a large file primes_1.txt on 
    $VSC_SCRATCH
  - Both the Slurm and PBS scripts generate files stdout.<jobid> and
    stderr.<jobid> with the output sent to stdout and stderr respectively.
* file3 scripts: An extension of the file2 example. file3.py first generate
  the primes_1.txt file on $VSC_SCRATCH just as file2, then reads it again and
  does some processing on the data.
