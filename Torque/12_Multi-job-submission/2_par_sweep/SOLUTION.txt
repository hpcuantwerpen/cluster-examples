Example for worker parameter sweep with a spreadsheet table as input.

* With atools
  - Load the atools module (as we need the arange command):
    module load atools/torque
  - Launch with qsub -t:
    qsub -t $(arange --data data.csv) weather.pbs

* With worker (will not port to Slurm clusters):
  - Load the worker module
  - Launch with wsub: 
    wsub -data data.csv -batch weather-worker.pbs

Note the difference in the resource specifications:
  - Torque array job with atools: Resources for a single job of the array
  - Worker: Resources for the overall worker process, so all array jobs
    together.
