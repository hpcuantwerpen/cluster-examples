# Example for worker parameter sweep with a spreadsheet table as input.
#
# * With Slurm and atools
#   - Load the atools module (as we need the arange command)
#   - Launch with sbatch --array:
#     sbatch --array $(arange --data data.csv) weather.slurm
#
# * With Torque and atools
#   - Load the atools module (as we need the arange command)
#   - Launch with qsub -t:
#     qsub -t $(arange --data data.csv) weather.pbs
#
# * With worker (Torque/Moab only):
#   - Load the worker module
#   - Launch with wsub: 
#     wsub -data data.csv -batch weather-worker.pbs
#
# Note the difference in the resource specifications:
# - Slurm and Torque array job with atools: Resources for a single job 
#   of the array
# - Worker: Resources for the overall worker process, so all array jobs
#   together.
